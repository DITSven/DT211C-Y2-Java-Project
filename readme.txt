Flowchart Maker:
A program for drawing basic flowchart shapes, arrows, and adding text. Originally to feature nesting, snapping, job allocation.

What works:
Default mode allows to move shapes by clicking and dragging on them (does not currently work for text).
Click on shape icon and then draw it on the canvas to create a shape. Resets to default mode after.
Right click on shape to delete (does not currently work on text).
New Page, Save and Open options are working and selectable from the File menu.
Undo is working for one action. Redo is currently not working.
Help/About displays message about project.

What doesn't:
Original design had nested canvases, role assignment and object snapping - none of which have been successfully implemented.

Other major problems with program:
Guidance shapes are not working.
Scroll bar not working.
